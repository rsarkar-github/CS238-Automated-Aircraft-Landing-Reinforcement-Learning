# CS238-Automated-Aircraft-Landing-Reinforcement-Learning

This is a project done for the CS238 class at Stanford. We use a Reinforcement Learning and Dynamic Programming ideas to teach an AI agent to land an aircraft, in the presence of uncertain cross-winds.

# Brief description of the files
learning_algorithm3.py : Code that implements a reinforcement learning agent that tries to solve the 2D and 3D MDP for the optimal policy.

dynamic_programming.py : Code that implements a Monte-Carlo based dynamic programming algorithm which we parallelize and run on a 140 core cluster.  

Const.py : A file which holds all the constants that we are using

simulator.py : The simulator that we made for the AI agent to interact with
